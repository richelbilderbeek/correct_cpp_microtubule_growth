## Exercise


Microtubules are a component of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells (and some bacteria) that play a key
role in cell-division, intracellular transport of vesicles, the movement of cell-organelles and cell motility.
Each microtubule consists of 13 protofilaments that form a hollow, straight tube with a high stiffness
that can grow as long as 50 μm (Fig. 17.10). The protofilaments are formed by the polymerisation of
heterodimers of α- and β-tubulin.

Experiments show that the assembly of microtubules can generate forces in the range of several pN
(1 pN [pico Newton] = 10 −12 N), which are sufficient to deform the membrane and move objects within
the cell. Microtubules that exert a force, however, are observed to grow more slowly. Elongation comes
to a stop when the load force is about 10 pN, which marks the maximum force (or stall force) that can
be generated by a single growing microtubule.
In order to investigate the force-velocity relationship in further detail, let us depict the microtubule
as a sheet of N = 13 parallel protofilaments that grows against a barrier (Fig. 17.11). The barrier is
supported by the longest protofilament, leaving gaps of different sizes between the barrier and the ends
of the trailing protofilaments. Given that the size of a tubulin heterodimer is d = 8 nm, subunits can
attach freely to the end of any protofilament that is more than d = 8 nm away from the barrier. Such
attachments occur at rate k on . The protofilaments that are closer to the barrier than d = 8 nm, can only
grow if a thermal fluctuation creates a gap between the barrier and the end of the protofilament that is
large enough to fit a tubulin dimer. This reduces the elongation rate of the protofilament by a factor
that depends on the force exerted on the barrier.


Under the assumption that the thermal fluctuations are fast relative to the timescale of polymerisation,
0
it can be shown that the modified rate of elongation of a protofilament, k on
, is given by

where F > 0 is the force exerted on the barrier, ∆x is the size of the gap that had to be created in
order to accommodate the subunit, k B = 1.3806485 · 10 −23 J/K is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the
temperature (measured in K). Protofilaments can also lose their terminal subunit. This occurs at rate
k off for each protofilament, irrespective of whether it currently supports the barrier or not.


Step 1: Implement the microtubule growth model explained above as a stochastic simulation, based
on the Gillespie algorithm. Estimate the rate of elongation (in μm/min) of the microtubule, measured
as the average rate at which the barrier is displaced over the course of a sufficiently long simulation.
Assume that the microtubule consists of N = 13 protofilaments and that adjacent protofilaments are
shifted relative to one another by h = d/13 nm (see the left diagram in Fig. 17.11). Use the following
values for the other parameters: F = 2.0 pN, T = 298 K, k on = 200 min -1 and k off = 50.0 min -1 . Note
that the maximum growth rate is (k on − k off ) d = 1.2 μm/min, so your answ
